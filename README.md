# Autocomplete search app in Cycle.js

Run `npm start` to install, setup, and locally deploy this web app.

## Job interview challenge

I'd like to know if you can work with an existing Cycle.js app to add features, refactor, modernize it, etc. If you don't know RxJS (or xstream) or Cycle.js yet, there are many resources on [my blog](https://staltz.com) and the [Cycle.js docs](https://cycle.js.org), including video tutorials.

1. Download this repo as a [zip file](https://gitlab.com/staltz/autocomplete-search/-/archive/master/autocomplete-search-master.zip) and extract it locally
2. Run it locally with `npm start` and get familiar with its features
3. Create a new local git repository for the project
4. **GOAL: Implement the following feature**

    When the user selects a Wikipedia result from the dropdown menu, **append** that result to a list rendered below the search field.

    Free-form text **cannot** be appended to the list, only items selected from the dropdown menu can be appended.

    BONUS POINTS: implement a "delete" button for each entry appended to the list.

    BONUS POINTS: update the dependencies in the codebase.

    BONUS POINTS: use `@cycle/state` for state management.

    BONUS POINTS: convert from JavaScript to modern TypeScript.

    BONUS POINTS: improve the UI/UX look and feel of the web app.
5. `git push` your repository to GitLab or GitHub
6. Send me a link to your repo at `contact@staltz.com`
7. Based on how well you perform the above, I'll contact you for the next stage of the interview
